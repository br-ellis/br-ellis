**What are some honest, unfiltered things about you?**

I strive to be professional, but can be goofy and sometimes it spills over into my worklife . For example:
  - Once a company I worked at held an IT-wide Discord stream and I chose to make my Discord username for that meeting "Sir Brian and His Magical Steed". Thankfully the CIO laughed.
  - Once when I was an intern (I had already received my full-time offer), a team training was held where the interns individually pitched a mock consulting solution for the betterment of a remote third-world village. Some interns
  pitched wells, others renewable energy...I pitched that the village needed a Hobby Lobby and I had made faux-bar charts and graphs to visually make my consulting presentation.
  
Beyond my silliness:
  - I'm very critical of myself (idk how I can be critical and silly at the same time but I am) so I strive to be the best version of me and be above reproach, to put at ease my inner critic. With that
  I've found I love constructive criticism from others but often needed encouragement/reminders that I'm doing good also.
  - I love a challenge and being curious. My wife would say my hobby is finding/having hobbies.
  - My principles and my faith come first, my family comes second, and my work comes third but I strive to show care, diligence, and mindfulness in all of those arenas.
  - My life quote is "I'm not there yet, but I'm on my way!" 

**What drives you nuts?**
- Honestly, I've never admitted this before to anyone who wasn't a personal friend of mine, but I hate office politics - I just don't enjoy the game.
I strive to be an authentic, kind, and empathetic person who puts others before himself so this always conflicted me; my friends have heard me say
numerous times "I'm not smart, I work with really smart people" - I hold others in high regards so never could stomach corporate politics. Taking credit myself for the bad and giving credit to others for the good is something
I admire to see in myself, my coworkers, and especially leadership. 

Ok now that my office politics spiel is over, here are some other things.

- I hate gossip and drama. If you have an issue with someone that you can't let go, bring it to them directly and respectfully. 
- Indecisiveness - let's make a decision, it's not that serious!
- Revisiting decisions - not the biggest fan of revisiting something we already agreed upon. 

**What are your quirks?**
- I'm an omnivert.
- I'm a hygiene freak and am notorious for being "that guy" in my friend group.
- I'm really into fashion, design, music, fragrance, etc. Those close to me would say I'm a creative guy who went the analytical route to make a living.

**How can people earn an extra gold star with you?**
- Be yourself, be empathetic, and recognize the humanity of the person sitting on the other end of the screen! ü´Ä  

**What qualities do you particularly value in people who work with you?**
- Kindess! Do unto me as you would have me do unto you.
- Banter
- Horizontal and vertical mentorship. I love to learn and it means alot when someone takes time out of their schedule to help me understand something.
- Patience
- Authenticity
  

**What are some things that people might misunderstand about you that you should clarify?**
- For all my joke talk above, I am professional üï¥Ô∏è I just find humor makes working with people better since our work is so collaborative and human-driven. 
- I‚Äôm an Enneagram Type 1: The Perfectionist. That's where my self-critical nature comes in, because I know I'm not perfect. However, my criticality never flows to coworkers since I am big on empathy and kindness.


**How do you coach people to do their best work and develop their talents?**
- There's never a dumb question to me - ask. 
- Be real about how you're doing and how we can share your loads.
- Have vision, without it people perish.

**What‚Äôs the best way to communicate with you?**
- Slack and Email 
- Give me context before meetings so I can get my gears turning. 

**What‚Äôs the best way to convince you to do something?**
- Be detailed in your request (who, what, when, what format, examples, etc.) as the more details you give me, the greater sense of urgency I perceive. 

**How do you like to give feedback?**
- 1:1 and in person   
- Supportive/constructive feedback with specific examples and suggestive options 

**How do you like to get feedback?**
- 1:1, immediately with support/constructive feedback, specific examples, and advice/suggestion on how to improve.

Beam me up, Scotty! Peace! ‚úä
